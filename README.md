## Project 1: JSON Server API Testing

**Collection File:** `Project #1 API Testing - json server.postman_collection.json`

This project involves testing APIs provided by a JSON Server, which is commonly used as a mock REST API for development and testing purposes. The collection includes various endpoints to perform CRUD operations.

## Project 2: OpenCart Registration Request

**Collection File:** `project #2 Opencart Registration request.postman_collection.json`

This project focuses on automating the registration process of OpenCart, an open-source online store management system. The collection simulates user registration by sending appropriate requests to the OpenCart API.

## Project 3: SOAP API Testing (Number Conversion)

**Collection File:** `Project #3- SOAP API Testing(Number conversion).postman_collection.json`

This project demonstrates testing of a SOAP-based web service that performs number conversion. The collection includes requests to convert numbers between different formats, showcasing how to handle SOAP requests in Postman.

## Project 4: Restful Booker API Testing

**Collection File:** `Project #4 - Restful Booker API Testing.json`

This project involves testing the Restful Booker API, a RESTful service designed for testing purposes. The collection covers various endpoints related to booking management, including creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting bookings.
